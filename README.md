# Detecting_Emotions

I've created a model to help news and entertainment media outlets classify headlines based on the emotions they convey so that they can select the right ones to keep readers interested in their content. 

Social media and microblogging platforms may also benefit from the use of such a tool in their efforts to identify fake news articles and hoaxes because highly provocative, emotional language is common feature among them (****citations). 

# Background

Headlines are designed to grab readers' attention so that they'll read articles and keep coming back for more content.

It should come as no surprise that the key to grabbing our attention is provoking emotions. In drawing out emotions, headline writers are tapping into some our most fundamental concerns. 

Emotions represent what psychologist Richard Lazarus called "core relational themes"... (****citation)

safety, wellbeing, and our ability to cope with challenges and achieve our goals. 

So when writers of headlines tap into our emotions, they're tapping into something powerful.

It may be tempting for media outlets to rely heavily on fear and anger to attract readers because they are are particularly effective in capturing and *holding* attention (****citations).

They've also been shown to be quicker to turn viral than emotionally neutral or low-arrousal content (Berger 2011). 

But unless you want your readership to be the tinfoil-hat-wearing kind, there is a danger in heavy reliance on high-arrousal context. 

(****citation on emotion and avoidance; citation on errosion of trust in the media)

Most of your readers will get fatigued and turn to other outlets for their news and entertainment. 

Positive content has staying power. (****citation) 

Hence, news and media providers have an interest in finding a balance of emotions on their front pages and personalized recommendations.

# Data Exploration

For this project, I analyzed a set of 1000 headlines collected from a variety of news sources including ...

The headlines are rated according to valence and emotion category. The emotion categories used are Paul Ekman's six basic emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprize.
