# Detecting_Emotions

I've created a model to help news and entertainment media outlets classify headlines based on the emotions they convey so that they can select the right ones to keep readers interested in their content.

Headlines are designed to grab readers' attention so that they'll read articles and keep coming back for more content.

The key to grabbing our attention is our emotions. In drawing out emotions, headline writers are tapping into some our most fundamental concerns: safety, wellbeing, and our ability to cope with challenges and achieve our goals. So when writers of headlines tap into our emotions, they're tapping into something powerful.

It may be tempting for media outlets to rely heavily on fear and anger to attract readers because they are are particularly effective in capturing and *holding* attention. But unless you want your readership to be the tinfoil-hat-wearing kind, there is a danger of over-use. Most of your readers will get fatigued and turn to other outlets for their news and entertainment. Hence, news and media providers have an interest in finding a balance on their front pages and personalized recommendations.
